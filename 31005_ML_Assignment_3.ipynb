        "I will discuss the possibility of predicting whether a Twitter message could be spread as a meme or not in this paper. The term “meme” firstly emerged from “The Selfish Gene” written by Richard Dawkins in 1976, it was defined as “the unit of culture transmission” (Dawkins, 1976 cited in Díaz C and Mauricio C, 2013). With the advance of the internet, the concept of “meme” is extended to the internet layer. The internet meme refers to a concept or idea that spread from one person to another through the internet (Díaz C and Mauricio C, 2013), it could be an image, an email, a video or any other things popular among the net-users.

        "On the other hand, the popular internet meme has changed all the time. Such popularity of a current meme could be suddenly transformed and non-directive that people cannot discover a pattern. In 2019, for example, the best memes are “Ugandan Knuckles”, “Super Bowl Selfie Kid”, “Gym Kardashian” …. However, the best memes for 2018 are “Don't say it”, “A Star is Born memes”, “Squinting woman” and so on. There are no similar memes according to the comparison of these two years. I believe that the biggest obstacle to solving this problem comes from humans themselves. "

The samples can be generated from TREC 2011 microblog track and it can be separated into two groups, one for training and one for testing. A threshold T is a pre-determined condition to distinguish between non-viral and viral tweets, the different values of T could cause the different predicted results for the same sample. Hence, this model can be validated by comparison with the accuracy of the predicted result under different thresholds T."
